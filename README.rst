git-split
=========

A tool to help when splitting repos into separate projects.

This is some rough work that was used to split a repo up into multiple separate
projects internally, and might be useful if someone needs to do the same again.

It needs a fair bit of work to knock it into a proper tool.

Note for the script to work you need to ensure /bin/sh points to /bin/bash
which is not the default for ubuntu systems which use dash.
